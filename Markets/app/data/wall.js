    content: "Our outlook got trumped<br /><br />Trump policies: Tax cuts priority for 2017 and should lift GDP late that year and 2018. Prior to Trump, we expected material slowing in GDP later in 2018. That has been delayed another year. <br /><br />Major uncertainty surrounds policies, but tax cut has wide Republican support. Infrastructure programmes desirable likely in 2018 and beyond. Trade and deregulation also major concerns. <br /><br />Fed more prone to hike rates, two hikes in 2017 and three in 2018.    Faster and more prolonged growth gives time for additional rate hikes.    <br /><br />Early 2017 inflation jump on energy that fades as the year progresses Base effects should lift headline inflation well above core rates in early 2017 but fade in the spring and in Q4. Core rate is likely to remain fairly stable, hovering around 2.0% for most of the year, with a second half cooling likely."
